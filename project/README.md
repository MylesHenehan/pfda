# Plan for conducting this project:
1. Find a Data set
2. Import and clean the data
3. Summarise the data set and variables
4. Basic analysis - mean, interesting data.
- Number of annual protests (line plot)
- Global protests by region (pie chart) - compare 90s and 00s to 10s.
- Pie chart of reasons behind protest per decade.
- Ireland in that period.
- Line plot with line per reason of protest in Ireland.
-  


5. Predictive trends.
6. Other metrics worth exploring.
