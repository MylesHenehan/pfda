# Assignments Repository
## This repository contains the 4 assignments due for the Programming for Data Analytics module. They are as follows:
### 1. assignment_2_weather: this involves reading in a CSV, extracting the data on temperature from the data set, and plotting it over time.
### 2. assignment_3_pie: this involves reading in a CSV directly from a URL, and creating a pie chart of the email domains contained in the data set.
### 3. assignment_5_risk: this involves simulating a game of risk and plotting the results.
### 4. assignment_6_weather: this contains a number of subtasks, extracting data from a very large data set and plotting different data points.

### Please note, having been travelling for 3 weeks in November, there is a significant gap in commits during this period.
